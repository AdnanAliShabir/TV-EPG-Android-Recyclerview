Electronic Program Guide for Android based on Recyclerview

This is a "classic" TV EPG which works on tablets and phones and allows you to scroll in all directions (horizontal, vertical and diagonal). 
Features:
- clicks can be handled on each program
- high performance rendering using the power of recyclerview. 
- tested for one month of 30 channels, using Nexus 5 - runs flawesly

Example project is located in repo.

Thats basically it. If you want to use it in your project you need resources from the example project as well as the EPG package for it to work. If you have any questions or such don't hesitate to contact me.

Good luck!
